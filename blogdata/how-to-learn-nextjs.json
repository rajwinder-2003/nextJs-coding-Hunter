    "content": "When I decided to build my blog, I found many tools out there that were readily available. I looked at Gastby along with content management systems like Ghost, Contentful, Sanity dot io, and HUGO But I needed something that I could have total control over. I've also always been someone who loves the flexibility of writing own my custom code. When I do this, I can conveniently go back to where any issues might be when a problem arises Gatsby provides this flexibility, and it is something I could get familiar with pretty easily since it's built on a library I use every day (React.js). But, I found out that I can do the exact same thing with Next.js by integrating MDX. Well... MDX is more or less like the markdown files we always see in GitHub repositories. MDX brings this flexibility into a markdown file by allowing you to literally write or import JavaScript (React) components into your articles. This in turn saves you from writing repetitive code",
